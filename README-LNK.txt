This fork of https://github.com/omeka/plugin-GoogleAnalytics is an attempt by a novice programmer who has only some experience with Python, Javascript, PHP, HTML, and CSS to update this plugin to work with Google Analytics GA4.

Submit new Omeka plugins: https://omeka.org/register/ --> (embeds a Google Form)

In my testing, it currently (as of 2/24/2023) doesn't appear to work with GA4, only GA3/"universal" at the latest.

I'm brand new to Github, and really have no idea what I'm doing.

Let me know if you have any questions!
